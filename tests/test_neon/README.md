# test_neon

This test is to check calculations of total cross sections, G values,
mean free path with more than one orbital medium.

We use the parameters of Neon gas and only consider 1 generations of 
electrons.

The numerically obtained data are compared with those from 
WolframEngine (WE). Since the calculation degradation in WE is heavy,
we avoid it by considering only 1 electron generation.
